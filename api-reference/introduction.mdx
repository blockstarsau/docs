## Welcome

Welcome to the CallX API's. Here you will find the available api endpoint and what they are used for. This introduction will provide details on how to test the api's from this documentation.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. Here you will pass any API Key you have created from your CallX account.

```json
"Authorization": Bearer {{your-api-key}}
```
